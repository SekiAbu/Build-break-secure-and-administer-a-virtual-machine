# These are the build steps
1. choose a virtual machine building software of choice. In this case i used oracle virtual box
2. Then choose the operating system and chose the ISO image file. This should be downloaded before hand that way it makes the process easier
3. Then choose the CPU, RAM and Disk space.
4. once the virtual machine is up and running, update and upgrade the necesesary apps to be used in the project.
 5. These steps can be done either using the CLI or GUI. The GUI makes installing the virtual machine easy. Then switching to the CLI for the other parts of the build process seemed easier.
